    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This one-skillet fettuccine with shrimp, tomatoes, and spinach cream sauce, 
        bright and fresh-tasting, cooks quickly. We love it with a simple tossed salad 
        and a great bread.</p> 

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces fettuccine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound shrimp</li>
        <li>salt andnfreshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup thunly sliced shallot</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 cups halved cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh spinach, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>flat-leaf parsley sprigs for garnish (optiona)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring 
            to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until 
            tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain; 
            reserving about 1/2 cup pasta water. </li>

        <li>Meanwhile, heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet 
            over medium heat until butter is melted. Slice 2 garlic 
            cloves, add to the skillet, and cook until lightly browned, 
            about 2 minutes. Remove garlic from the skillet and discard. </li>

        <li>Carefully add shrimp to the skillet with a pinch of salt and 
            pepper. Cook until shrimp is pink, opaque, and curled into a 
            “C” shape, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and keep warm. </li>

        <li>Add shallot to the skillet and cook, stirring, until softened, 2 to 3 
            minutes; stir in red pepper flakes. Mince remaining 2 garlic cloves; 
            add to skillet and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. </li>

        <li>Add sliced tomatoes, minced parsley, and white wine. Bring to a boil, 
            and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in chopped spinach; cook until just 
            wilted and bright green. Return cooked shrimp to the skillet; stir in 
            cream. Season to taste with salt and pepper. </li>

        <li>Remove from heat. If sauce is too thick, stir in 1 tablespoon pasta 
            water at a time, until desired consistency is achieved. Stir in pasta, 
            and ladle into serving bowls. Garnish with additional flat leaf parsley sprigs. </li>

    
    </ol>
