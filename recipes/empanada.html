    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon Goya Extra Virgin Olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 medium yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Goya Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>6 Goya Spanish Olives Stuffed with Minced Pimientos, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Goya Sofrito</li>
        <li>1 packet Sazon Goya with Coriander and Annatto</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Goya Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>1.2 teaspoon Goya Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>Goya Ground Black Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 package yellow or white Goya Discos empanada discs, thawed</li>
        <li>1 quart Goya Corn Oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef; 
            cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Add onions 
            and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. </li>

        <li>Stir in tomato sauce, olives, sofrito, saz√≥n, garlic, oregano, and pepper. 
            Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until mixture thickens, about 15 
            minutes. </li>

        <li>Roll empanada disks on a lightly floured surface until 1/2 inch larger in 
            diameter. Spoon about 1 tablespoon meat mixture into the middle of each disk. 
            Moisten the disk edges with water, fold in half over filling to form a 
            half-moon, and pinch to seal (or seal with a fork). </li>

        <li>Heat 2 1/2 inches corn oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F 
            (175 degrees C). Working in batches, fry empanadas until crisp and golden brown, 
            flipping once, 4 to 6 minutes. </li>

        <li>Transfer to paper towels to drain. Enjoy!</li>
